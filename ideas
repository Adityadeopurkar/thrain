Main Work:
1. Search for another algorithm apart from shamir's secret sharing algorithm to break the text.
2. Use threading for shamir's secret as hex conversion is time extensive process.
3. Use two libraries:Cryptography and pycrypto.cipher and implement algorithms
4. Make a small report or search about those algorithms (analysis of with is better in which aspect)
5. We will be needing a key, which will be used in encryption and decryption [Hardik's work]
6. Using the key, encryption will be done.
7. That key will be encrypted using private key and will be send as public key. [Dellie hellman algorithm]
8. The public key will be decrypted.
9. This key will be sent to decryption algorithm where it will be decrypted.
10. Encryption and decryption of file using key will be done on a stand alone application
11. A basic key will be generated, it will be used to encrypt on the stand alone application
12. The application will output two text files, encrypted text and a text file containing key.
13. The file and key will be uploaded online. The program on the background will encrypt the public key and transfer it. Only the user to which it sent can access it ethically.[Login system is to be made]
14. On reciever's end, the encrypted file will be downloaded.


Extra Ideas:
Online free database can be made at: https://rethinkdb.com/
It has python API, thus it can be used with stand alone application too

How things happened:
1. Take a text file and break it using shamir secret algorithm
2. We obtain a list of hexadecimal codes, we further break it using shamir's secret. This list of list is the output.
3. We now encrypt it using various enryption algorithm
